I have designed a resume-generator website called <b>AHIN Resume Creator</b>, that creates a formatted resume for the user. <b>My website contains five form-like webpages, which injects user-provided data into a resume template</b>. The resume website consists of the following webpages:
<ol>
<li>The first webpage requires the user to fill "<b>Introductory Information</b>" about him/her like Name, Field of Study, and Location.
<li>The second webpage "<b>Objective & Skills</b>" queries the user for the Objective of the Resume. The skills he/she has acquired through his/her academic and non-academic career is also inquired.</li>
<li>Then, the third page requires the person to enter his/her own "<b>Work Experience</b>." The site inquires for information on user's Latest Job. The Company Name, Job Title, Job Type, and two brief lines explaining the job is asked.</li>
<li>The fourth webpage is titled "<b>Curricular Activities</b>" & "<b>Extra-Curricular Activities.</b>" The "Curricular Activities" section requires the user to enter at least one school he/she attended. Details about the college/school like School Location and Study Period are inquired. The "Extra-Curricular Activities" section requires the user to enter a brief description of two non-curriculum activities he/she is involved in.</li> 
<li>Finally, the fifth (and optional) webpage "<b>Personal Projects</b>" asks the user to enter project links and the respective descriptions into the displayed form fields. After submitting the fifth page, the next page will display the generated resume.</li>
